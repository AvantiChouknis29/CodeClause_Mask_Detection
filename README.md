Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow
This project is a simple face mask detection application using OpenCV and TensorFlow in Python. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to classify whether a person in an image or video frame is wearing a face mask or not. The Haar Cascade classifier is used for face detection, and the model is loaded from a saved h5 file. The application annotates the detected faces with rectangles and labels indicating whether they are wearing masks or not.
